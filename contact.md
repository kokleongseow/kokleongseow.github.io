What’s up, people! I’m Kok-Leong Seow (Coke-Lee-Ong-See-Ow!)! Or just Andy lol. I got my BS in CS at Wichita State University and recently dropped out of my graduate program at Columbia University to be a part of the Insight Fellowship in Silicon Valley!

I enjoy constructive (and destructive) critism, so if you see any errors or have any questions, comments, and/or concerns, please contact me via email (k.seow@columbia.edu) or social media (@KokLeongSeow)! I look foward to hearing from y'all! God bless!
